ðŸ§ª Bonus Task â€“ Quantum Computing Simulation with IBM Quantum Experience
ðŸ’¡ Objective:
Use IBM Quantum Experience to build a basic quantum circuit that demonstrates how quantum computing can optimize an AI task, like speeding up search or inference.

ðŸ“˜ Concept Title:
Quantum Circuit for Accelerated Search using Groverâ€™s Algorithm

âœ… Why This Matters:
Traditional AI systems perform search and optimization linearly, which becomes inefficient for large datasets. Groverâ€™s Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that finds the desired item in an unsorted dataset in âˆšN time, significantly faster than classical methods.

This can be applied to:

Drug discovery (searching molecular combinations)

Feature selection in ML models

Fast anomaly detection

| **1. Initialization**     | Start with two qubits in a superposition state using Hadamard gates |
| **2. Oracle**             | Mark the target state (solution) by flipping its amplitude          |
| **3. Diffusion Operator** | Amplify the marked state's probability                              |
| **4. Measurement**        | Collapse the superposition and get the optimal result               |
