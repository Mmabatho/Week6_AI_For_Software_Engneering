 The Adaptive Urban Climate Orchestration System (AUCOS) addresses the critical challenge of urban climate management through AI-powered coordination of city infrastructure.
Key Features of the Concept Paper:

✅ Problem Identification: Clear explanation of urban climate challenges facing cities by 2030

✅ AI Workflow: Detailed technical architecture including data inputs, model types (reinforcement learning, CNN-LSTM, graph neural networks), and outputs

✅ Societal Benefits: Quantified public health, economic, and environmental advantages

✅ Risk Analysis: Thorough discussion of privacy, bias, security, and democratic concerns with mitigation strategies

✅ Implementation Timeline: Realistic deployment schedule through 2030
The concept balances technical innovation with practical implementation considerations, making it suitable for academic submission while demonstrating forward-thinking about AI's role in addressing climate challenges.
